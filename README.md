# CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell

My journey to explore Haskell programming language through lecture notes,
homework, and assignments in:

* [CIS 194 Spring 2013](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html)
* [CIS 194 Fall 2014](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/fall14/lectures.html)
* [CIS 194 Fall 2016](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/fall16/)

For the two fall semesters,
I will just cover the topics that are interesting to me:
testing, gloss, functional reactive programming, and lenses.

## Assignments

Many of the assignments are unit tested.
I used `cabal` to manage dependencies, build and run the assignments.
You can `cd` in each assignment's directory and run `cabal test` to run the unit tests.
Some assignments have CLI,
thus, you can use `cabal run <hwxx>` to bring up the CLI.

## Final Project

I have some ideas to implement for the final project.
I'll update the repo with the link to the project once I have the time to finish it.
